How to get the most out of this session: 

0) Fork/clone the repo
1) Open up each of the test files.
2) Create a test similar to each of the existing.
NO COPY-PASTE. Your brain learns much better when you type everything in.
3) Create further tests ...
4) Keep adding tests and learning new features every day until mastery ...
